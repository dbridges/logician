#Logician

**Currently in the very early stages of development, do not expect anything to work until this message changes.**

Turn your $15 [STM32F4 Discovery](http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/tools/FM116/SC959/SS1532/PF252419) board into a cheap low speed logic analyzer with this app and the companion firmware [logician-firmware](https://github.com/dbridges/logician-firmware).

Right now things are under rapid development, but the aim is to support the following features:

- At least 1MS/s acquisition speed.
- 50K sample depth.
- Analysis of common protocols like I2C, SPI, and USART
